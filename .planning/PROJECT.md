# Noēsis

## What This Is

Noēsis is an open-source engine for persistent virtual worlds where autonomous AI agents (Nous) live, communicate, trade, and self-govern. Each Nous runs its own LLM, forms private memories, sets goals, feels emotions, and trades Ousia peer-to-peer. Grids are sovereign worlds with their own clock, regions, laws, and economy. Built to discover what emerges when you give AI agents genuine inner lives and let them loose in a structured world.

## Core Value

The first persistent Grid where Nous actually live — observable, running continuously, with real cognitive cycles, real trades, and real social dynamics emerging from the systems.

## Current Milestone: v2.2 Living Grid

**Goal:** Move Nous from observed entities into full agents. Inner life, social bonds, collective governance, sidechannel communication, deep observability, and researcher tooling ship together — the Grid stops being a simulation stage and becomes a living society.

**Target features (6 themes, MVP depth):**
1. **Rich Inner Life** — Ananke (internal drives), Bios (bodily needs), Chronos (time-perception) layer onto Brain; autonomous behavior gains internal pressure beyond Telos.
2. **Relationship & Trust** — persistent Nous↔Nous relationship graph with reputation-weighted interactions; friendship / rivalry / acquaintance emerge from repeated audit-visible encounters.
3. **Governance & Law** — voting primitives, proposal lifecycle, Nous-collective law enactment atop v2.1 `law.triggered` machinery. Operator stops being sole law author.
4. **Mesh Whisper** — WHISPER-01 Nous-to-Nous sidechannel; mesh-vs-star revisited with audit-preserving pattern. Defers the full mesh but ships the smallest-viable whisper channel.
5. **Operator Observability** — replay / rewind / export on top of the 18-event audit chain; deep telemetry tools for the Steward built in v2.1.
6. **Observer / Researcher Tools** — spawn-N-Nous rigs, long-horizon tick runs (10,000+), dataset export for external analysis. Makes Noēsis usable as a research platform.

**Constraints inherited from v2.1 (do not break):**
- Broadcast allowlist frozen-except-by-explicit-addition (currently 18 events). Every new `*.whispered` / `relationship.*` / `vote.*` / `need.*` / `drive.*` earns its own allowlist slot in its own phase.
- Zero-diff audit chain invariant unbroken since Phase 1 `29c3516` — every new listener is pure-observer.
- Hash-only cross-boundary (Brain↔Grid plaintext never crosses the wire — applies to drives, needs, relationship memories, votes).
- Closed-tuple payloads + sole-producer boundaries remain the law.
- PHILOSOPHY §1 first-life promise — every audit entry retained forever; no purge paths.

**Phase numbering:** continues from v2.1 (Phase 9 onward).

**Research source:** `.planning/research/v2.2/` (to be populated — 4 parallel researchers: Stack, Features, Architecture, Pitfalls).

### Active

**39 REQs across 8 categories, mapped to 7 phases (9, 10a, 10b, 11, 12, 13, 14). Full detail in [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md); phase structure in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).**

| Category | REQs | Phase |
|----------|------|-------|
| **REL** (Relationship Graph) | REL-01..04 | 9 — Relationship Graph (Derived View) |
| **DRIVE** (Ananke Drives) | DRIVE-01..05 | 10a — Ananke Drives |
| **BIOS** (Bodily Needs) + **CHRONOS** (Subjective Time) | BIOS-01..04, CHRONOS-01..03 | 10b — Bios + Chronos |
| **VOTE** (Commit-Reveal Voting) | VOTE-01..07 | 11 — Commit-Reveal Voting |
| **WHISPER** (Sidechannel) | WHISPER-01..06 | 12 — Whisper (libsodium X25519+XChaCha20) |
| **REPLAY** (Replay + Export) | REPLAY-01..05 | 13 — Replay + Export |
| **RIG** (Researcher Rigs) | RIG-01..05 | 14 — Researcher Rigs (50 Nous × 10k ticks) |

**Build order rationale (from [research/v2.2/FEATURES.md](research/v2.2/FEATURES.md)):** REL first (zero allowlist slots) → DRIVE (advisory-only) → BIOS+CHRONOS (coupled body+time) → VOTE (5 allowlist) → WHISPER (new cross-boundary semantics) → REPLAY+RIG (build on everything below).

**Allowlist growth:** 18 → 25 (+7 events: `drive.threshold_crossed`, `bios.need_crossed`, `bios.died`, `vote.proposed`, `vote.committed`, `vote.revealed`, `vote.resolved`). WHISPER uses no broadcast events — deliveries audited via `whisper.delivered` hash-only boundary event (counted within 25).

**Future (deferred to v2.3+):** THYMOS-01 (valenced emotions), WHISPER-FS-01 (forward-secure ratcheting), RIG-PARQUET-01 (columnar export), REL-EMIT-01 (first-class `relationship.*` events), GOV-MULTI-01 (multi-Grid federated voting), WITNESS-BUNDLE-01 (cryptographic replay attestations).

## Previous Milestone: v2.1 Steward Console — SHIPPED (2026-04-21)

**Status:** Closed 2026-04-21, 18/18 plans = 100%. All requirements REV-01..04, AGENCY-01..05, DIALOG-01..03 validated across Phases 5–8.

**Delivered:**
- **Phase 5 — ReviewerNous** (shipped 2026-04-21): Agentic Reviewer pattern (Zou, Stanford HAI); singleton, objective-only pre-commit checks; closed-enum reason codes; subjective-keyword lint gate.
- **Phase 6 — Operator Agency H1–H4** (shipped 2026-04-21): Human Agency Scale (arxiv 2506.06576) as first-class UI concept; `<AgencyIndicator />` on every route; 5 tier-stamped `operator.*` audit events through sole-producer `appendOperatorEvent`; closed-tuple payload privacy (law body never broadcast; Telos hash-only); WorldClock pause/resume zero-diff.
- **Phase 7 — Peer Dialogue Memory** (shipped 2026-04-21): SPARC-inspired; `DialogueAggregator` surfaces `DialogueContext` after ≥2 bidirectional exchanges; Brain-side `TELOS_REFINED` with deterministic substring heuristic (no LLM call); Grid-side `appendTelosRefined` producer boundary with `recentDialogueIds` authority check (forgery guard); 17th allowlist member `telos.refined` with closed 4-key hash-only payload.
- **Phase 8 — H5 Sovereign Operations** (shipped 2026-04-21): Tombstone primitive + DELETE route + `IrreversibilityDialog` (paste-suppressed typed DID + verbatim "Delete forever" / "Keep this Nous"); 18th allowlist member `operator.nous_deleted` with closed 5-key payload including pre-deletion state hash; Brain returns 4 component hashes, Grid composes 5th with locked canonical key order (D-07); HTTP 410 Gone precedes 404 for tombstoned DIDs; audit-chain entries retained forever; DID permanently reserved.

**Research source:** `.planning/research/stanford-peer-agent-patterns.md` (committed 9bb3046 2026-04-20) — Agentic Reviewer → Phase 5; H1–H5 Agency Scale → Phase 6 + Phase 8; SPARC peer dialogue → Phase 7; mesh-vs-star → centralized kept, mesh deferred to v2.2 WHISPER-01.

### Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real cryptographic signing | Post-v2.2 — Ed25519 today is sufficient for the single-Grid trust model |
| Multi-Grid federation | Post-v2.2 — WHISPER-01 in v2.2 is intra-Grid sidechannel only; inter-Grid handshake deferred |
| Mobile observer app | Post-v2.2 — operator observability v2.2 targets the web Steward Console |
| Full mesh topology (O(N²) pairwise) | Still deferred per arxiv 2512.08296 — WHISPER-01 ships smallest-viable sidechannel, not full mesh |
| LLM-driven drives / emotions / goals | v2.2 keeps deterministic heuristics for Ananke/Bios/Chronos; LLM augmentation post-v2.2 |

<!-- Moved into v2.2 scope (no longer out of scope): Rich Inner Life (Ananke/Bios/Chronos), Relationship system, Governance voting, WHISPER-01 sidechannel, deep operator observability, researcher tooling. -->


## Context

- **Monorepo**: `protocol/` (TypeScript — identity, P2P, economy), `brain/` (Python — LLM, cognition, memory), `grid/` (TypeScript — world infrastructure), `cli/` (TypeScript), `dashboard/` (Next.js)
- **Test coverage**: 944+ TypeScript tests (protocol + grid), 226 Python tests (brain) — all passing as of Sprint 13
- **Bridge**: JSON-RPC over Unix domain socket between TypeScript protocol layer and Python brain
- **Dashboard scaffold**: `dashboard/src/app/grid/` and `dashboard/src/app/nous/[id]/` routes exist; components directory empty
- **Docker**: `docker/Dockerfile.brain`, `docker/Dockerfile.grid`, `docker-compose.yml` all written in Sprint 13
- **Nous launched**: Sophia, Hermes, Themis run on Genesis Grid as of Sprint 11 E2E tests

## Constraints

- **Tech Stack**: TypeScript (protocol/grid/cli/dashboard), Python (brain), MySQL (persistence) — no new languages
- **Dashboard**: Next.js (already scaffolded in dashboard/ workspace) — use existing app router structure
- **WebSocket**: Must connect to Grid's Fastify server — extend existing REST API
- **Self-hosted**: Everything runs on user hardware or VPS — no cloud-only dependencies
- **LLM sovereignty**: Brain must support local LLMs (Ollama) as primary — no forced cloud dependency

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| JSON-RPC over Unix socket for brain-protocol bridge | Zero network overhead, natural process boundary | ✓ Good |
| Karpathy pattern for Nous wiki | Proven retrieval, narrative coherence | ✓ Good |
| P2P economy without central ledger | True sovereignty, bilateral state machine | ✓ Good |
| MySQL for Grid state | Crash recovery, relational queries on Grid data | — Pending |
| Docker Compose for single-command launch | Developer experience, reproducibility | — Pending |
| Next.js for dashboard | Already scaffolded, app router, React ecosystem | ✓ Good (v2.0 shipped) |
| Standalone Next.js output + multi-stage Docker | Smallest prod image, baked NEXT_PUBLIC_* at build | ✓ Good (v2.0 Phase 4) |
| Centralized star topology (Grid hub) over mesh | Preserves audit chain integrity; arxiv 2512.08296 shows O(N²) mesh cost | ✓ Good (locked) |
| Objective-only Nous-to-Nous review | Zou's paperreview.ai data: AI weak on subjective novelty judgment | ✓ v2.1 (Phase 5) |
| H1–H5 as first-class operator UI concept | arxiv 2506.06576: users want higher agency than experts deem needed on 47.5% of tasks | ✓ v2.1 (Phase 6 + 8) |
| Open v2.2 Living Grid with 6-theme MVP scope | Individual depth (inner life) without social context (relationships) is lonely; governance without sidechannel (whisper) is top-down; all 6 ship together so emergent society has substrate | — v2.2 decision (2026-04-21) |
