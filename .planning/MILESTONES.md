---

## v2.1: Steward Console (SHIPPED — 2026-04-21, 18/18 plans)

**Goal:** Turn the observational dashboard into a stewarded environment. Operators can intervene at explicit agency tiers, Nous review each other's proposed actions on objective invariants only, and peer dialogue meaningfully mutates goals.

**Research foundation:** `.planning/research/stanford-peer-agent-patterns.md` (2026-04-20)
- Agentic Reviewer pattern (Zou, Stanford HAI) → ReviewerNous
- Human Agency Scale H1–H5 (arxiv 2506.06576) → operator UI
- SPARC peer-dialogue → telos.refined from two-Nous exchanges

**Target features:**
- ReviewerNous — objective-only pre-commit checks on trades (REV-01, REV-02)
- Operator Agency Tiers — H1–H5 first-class UI concept with tier-stamped audit events (AGENCY-01, AGENCY-02, AGENCY-03)
- Peer Dialogue Memory — `telos.refined` from two-Nous exchanges (DIALOG-01, DIALOG-02)

### Sprint 15 / v2.1 — Phase 5 SHIPPED

**Shipped:** 2026-04-21
**Phase:** 5 — ReviewerNous — Objective-Only Pre-Commit Review
**Requirements closed:** REV-01, REV-02, REV-03, REV-04
**Plans:** 5/5 (05-01, 05-02, 05-03, 05-04, 05-05)

**Key artifacts shipped:**
- `grid/src/review/` module — 5 objective-invariant check handlers (balance, counterparty DID, positive integer amount, memory-ref existence, no contradicting Telos)
- Closed-enum `ReviewFailureCode` — reason codes are never free-form text (REV-02)
- REV-04 subjective-keyword lint gate — test fails if a handler mentions fairness/wisdom/taste/quality/novelty
- Reviewer singleton at `did:noesis:reviewer` with first-fail-wins dispatch loop (REV-03)
- Brain schema extension: `memoryRefs: list[str]` + `telosHash: str` on `trade_request` action
- 3-event audit flow: `trade.proposed` → `trade.reviewed` → `trade.settled` (REV-01, REV-02)
- 11-event broadcast allowlist (was 10 pre-Phase-5) — `trade.reviewed` added
- D-12 privacy regression test: `memoryRefs`/`telosHash` NEVER leak to broadcast payload
- D-13 zero-diff invariant regression test: 100-tick sim with reviewer matches bypass hash modulo allowed `trade.reviewed` entries
- D-11 STATE.md reconciliation — phantom `trade.countered` purged, 11-event enumeration explicit
- `scripts/check-state-doc-sync.mjs` — new CI gate against future STATE.md drift

**Key decisions locked:** D-01..D-13 (see `.planning/phases/05-reviewernous-objective-only-pre-commit-review/05-CONTEXT.md`)

**Next up:** Phase 6 — Operator Agency Foundation (H1–H4)

### Sprint 16 / v2.1 — Phase 6 SHIPPED

**Shipped:** 2026-04-20
**Phase:** 6 — Operator Agency Foundation (H1–H4)
**Requirements closed:** AGENCY-01, AGENCY-02 (partial — H3 allowlist-mutate deferred), AGENCY-03, AGENCY-04
**Plans:** 6/6 (06-01, 06-02, 06-03, 06-04, 06-05, 06-06)

**Key artifacts shipped:**
- `grid/src/audit/operator-events.ts` — sole sanctioned producer for all `operator.*` events; `requireTierInPayload` + closed-tuple payload enforcement
- 16-event broadcast allowlist (was 11 pre-Phase-6) — 5 new `operator.*` events added (`inspected`, `paused`, `resumed`, `law_changed`, `telos_forced`)
- H1–H4 operator tier system: persistent Agency Indicator on every dashboard route, H2 memory query, H3 pause/resume + law CRUD, H4 force-Telos
- Elevation dialog with native `<dialog>.showModal()` focus trap — single-action scope (tier auto-downgrades to H1 after dispatch, AGENCY-04)
- Closure-capture discipline in `use-elevated-action` — tier stamped at confirm-click time, never at HTTP-arrival time (SC#4 race regression test)
- D-19 hash-only audit for force-Telos — HEX64 guard on both before/after hashes; no plaintext goals ever enter the audit payload
- `AgencyStore` + `useSyncExternalStore` subscriber pattern — SSR-safe H1 default, no hydration flash
- D-12 privacy regression: forbidden-key pattern `/prompt|response|wiki|reflection|thought|emotion_delta/i` blocks operator payload leaks
- H5 Sovereign Nous deletion = disabled placeholder with "requires Phase 8" tooltip (no onClick bound)

**Key decisions locked:** D-01..D-19 (see `.planning/phases/06-operator-agency-foundation-h1-h4/06-CONTEXT.md`)

**Deferred:** AGENCY-02 item "mutate broadcast allowlist at runtime" — requires rethinking frozen-set invariant; filed for later mini-phase

**Next up:** Phase 7 — Peer Dialogue → Telos Refinement (DIALOG-01, DIALOG-02, DIALOG-03)

### Sprint 17 / v2.1 — Phase 7 SHIPPED

**Shipped:** 2026-04-21
**Phase:** 7 — Peer Dialogue → Telos Refinement
**Requirements closed:** DIALOG-01, DIALOG-02, DIALOG-03
**Plans:** 4/4 (07-01, 07-02, 07-03, 07-04)

**Key artifacts shipped:**
- Brain-side peer-dialogue memory integration: `PeerDialogueMemory` + `TelosRefinementEngine` consume two-Nous exchanges → emit `telos.refined` with before/after hash tuple + triggering dialogue id (DIALOG-01)
- Grid-side `appendTelosRefined` sole-producer boundary at `grid/src/audit/append-telos-refined.ts` — enforces DIALOGUE_ID_RE + HEX64_RE on producer side (T-07-P1); no other code path may emit `telos.refined` (DIALOG-02)
- 17-event broadcast allowlist (was 16 pre-Phase-7) — `telos.refined` added; closed-tuple payload `{did, before_goal_hash, after_goal_hash, triggered_by_dialogue_id}` — plaintext-never invariant preserved (PHILOSOPHY §1)
- NousRunner telos-refined branch: `recentDialogueIds` authority pattern — runner maintains the set; telos engine consumes but does not own it (T-07-P3 resolution)
- Dashboard surfaces (DIALOG-03):
  - New `'dialogue'` Chip variant — indigo-400 `#818CF8` on `#17181C` (Phase 7 tier-palette slot, 6.4:1 contrast)
  - `TelosRefinedBadge` at panel level on Inspector's TelosSection (D-27/D-30: panel-level, not per-goal) — `↻ refined via dialogue (N)` label, click navigates to firehose filtered by triggering dialogue_id
  - `useRefinedTelosHistory` derived selector over existing `useFirehose()` — zero new RPC, zero new WebSocket subscription
  - `useFirehoseFilter` URL hook — parses `?firehose_filter=dialogue_id:<16-hex>` with DIALOGUE_ID_RE validation; malformed → filter null (chip not mounted)
  - `FirehoseFilterChip` + dim-not-hide firehose rows (`opacity-40 pointer-events-none` on non-match; matching rows full opacity) — AC-4-3-3 preserves temporal debugging context
  - AC-4-3-4 zero-diff guard: firehose renders byte-identical to pre-Phase-7 output when filter is null
- Color-scope invariant: `#818CF8` confined to 8 allowlisted files; cross-file `node:fs` walker enforces in `telos-refined-badge.test.tsx`
- Plaintext-never source invariant: no `new_goals`, `goal_description`, or `utterance` strings in dashboard sources (grep-based test)

**Key decisions locked:** D-20..D-30 (see `.planning/phases/07-peer-dialogue-telos-refinement/07-CONTEXT.md`)

**STRIDE threats addressed:** T-07-P1 (producer-boundary plaintext leak), T-07-P2 (dialogue_id spoofing — regex gate at producer and consumer), T-07-P3 (recentDialogueIds authority ambiguity), T-07-P4 (color-palette bleed across phases)

**Next up:** v2.2 milestone planning (or Phase 8 — Sovereign Nous deletion / AGENCY-05)

---

### v2.1 Phase 8 — H5 Sovereign Operations (Nous Deletion) — SHIPPED (2026-04-21)

**Requirement:** AGENCY-05 — H5 Sovereign tier executes irreversible Nous deletion with typed-DID consent + pre-deletion state hash + runtime removal + audit-chain preservation forever.

**Delivered (3 plans, 3 waves):**

- **Plan 08-01 — Tombstone primitives + state hash (Wave 1)**
  - `NousRecord.status: 'active' | 'deleted'` + `deletedAtTick?: number`; `registry.tombstone(did, tick, spatialMap)` method; `removeNous(did)` no-op on tombstoned (never unreserves DID)
  - `grid/src/registry/tombstone-check.ts` — `tombstoneCheck()` throws `TombstonedDidError` with `statusHint=410`
  - `grid/src/audit/state-hash.ts` — `combineStateHash({psyche, thymos, telos, memory_stream})` canonical JSON SHA-256 with **LOCKED** canonical key order `psyche→thymos→telos→memory_stream` (D-07) via engine-safe manual `canonicalSerialize`
  - `brain/src/noesis_brain/state_hash.py` — `compute_pre_deletion_state_hash()` returns 4 component hashes; Brain composes nothing (Grid composes 5th)
  - `brain/src/noesis_brain/rpc.py` — `hash_state` method on `BrainHandler`
- **Plan 08-02 — DELETE route + audit producer + allowlist growth (Wave 2)**
  - Broadcast allowlist bumped **17 → 18** with `operator.nous_deleted` at position 18; `Object.defineProperty` freeze throws `TypeError` on any mutation
  - `grid/src/audit/append-nous-deleted.ts` — SOLE producer; validates `tier==='H5'` + `action==='delete'` + DID + HEX64; closed 5-key literal (NO spread); `Object.keys().sort()` assertion; `payload.operator_id === actorOperatorId` self-report invariant
  - `grid/src/api/operator/delete-nous.ts` — DELETE `/api/v1/operator/nous/:did`; 9-step error ladder 400/404/410/503 (**NO 500s** anywhere); D-30 order: validate → tombstoneCheck → Brain hash_state RPC → registry.tombstone → coordinator.despawnNous → appendNousDeleted
  - `coordinator.despawnNous(did)` — close bridge, unsubscribe tick, drop spatial
  - `nous-runner.onTick` — tick-skip guard: `if record.status === 'deleted' return early` (STRIDE T-08-33/34)
  - `tombstoneCheck` centralized in inspect, memory-query, telos-force, delete-nous routes — **HTTP 410 precedes 404** for tombstoned DIDs
  - Zero-diff audit chain preserved: `nous-deleted-zero-diff.test.ts` pins `Date.now()` via `vi.setSystemTime()` for cross-listener head comparison
  - Audit entries **never purged**: `audit-no-purge.test.ts` confirms `chain.verify()` passes after tombstone + delete; DID **permanently reserved** (re-creation rejected)
- **Plan 08-03 — Dashboard UX: two-stage H5 flow + firehose destructive styling (Wave 3)**
  - `IrreversibilityDialog` primitive: native `<dialog>` + `showModal()` + `role="alertdialog"` + aria-labelledby/describedby + autoFocus on Cancel + paste suppression (`onPaste preventDefault`) + Enter blocked + focus trap
  - Copy verbatim-locked (D-04/D-05): `TITLE_COPY`, `WARNING_COPY`, `DELETE_LABEL = 'Delete forever'`, `CANCEL_LABEL = 'Keep this Nous'`, DID label — pinned in test assertions, any paraphrase fails
  - Delete gated on exact case-sensitive `typed === targetDid` (substring-match explicitly rejected)
  - Closure-capture race-safety (D-22): `capturedDidRef.current = targetDid` at dialog-open time — mid-flight Inspector selection change cannot mutate committed DID
  - Two-stage elevation: `ElevationDialog(H5)` → `IrreversibilityDialog` → `deleteNous()` → auto-downgrade H5→H1 on all 4 close paths
  - D-20/D-21 hydration rejection regression pinned: `agency-store.test.ts` proves `localStorage['noesis.operator.tier'] = 'H5'` hydrates to H1 (whitelist `{H1,H2,H3,H4}`); H2-H4 round-trip; malformed no-throw
  - Inspector State A/B/C (active / tombstoned / loading-or-error); firehose destructive styling on `operator.nous_deleted`: `border-l-2 border-rose-900` + `bg-rose-900/20 text-rose-300` + `text-red-400 line-through` on actor
  - Toast auto-dismiss (4s via useEffect cleanup); inline error scoped to `irrevOpen`

**Crown-jewel invariants preserved:**
- **Sole-producer boundary** — grep-verified across entire `grid/src/`: only `append-nous-deleted.ts:132` emits `operator.nous_deleted`
- **Hash-only cross-boundary** — Brain returns 4 component hashes; Grid composes 5th with locked canonical key order; no plaintext state crosses the bridge
- **Closed 5-key tuple** — `{tier, action, operator_id, target_did, pre_deletion_state_hash}` with structural sorted-key equality; no spread; self-report invariant
- **Zero-diff audit chain** — unbroken since Phase 1 `29c3516`; listener count does not affect chain head
- **First-life promise** — audit entries for deleted Nous retained forever; DID permanently reserved (no reuse)
- **Error ladder has no 500s** — only 400/404/410/503
- **D-30 deletion order locked** — validate → tombstoneCheck → Brain hash_state → tombstone → despawnNous → appendNousDeleted
- **Broadcast allowlist frozen at 18** — growth-only via explicit phase addition; `scripts/check-state-doc-sync.mjs` regression gate

**Key decisions locked:** D-01..D-40 (see `.planning/phases/08-h5-sovereign-operations-nous-deletion/08-CONTEXT.md`). D-04/D-05 (copy verbatim), D-07 (canonical key order), D-20 (H5 hydration rejection), D-21 (H5 whitelist regression), D-22 (closure-capture), D-30 (deletion order), D-31 (H5 default-ON behind IrreversibilityDialog), D-38 (sole-producer boundary).

**STRIDE threats addressed:** T-08-33 (tick-skip guard prevents post-tombstone Brain RPC), T-08-34 (coordinator.despawnNous releases bridge + spatial + tick subscription before audit emit — no orphan resources).

**Test counts at ship:** grid **656/656**, brain **310/310**, dashboard **404/404**. Phase 8 added 9 grid tests + 15 Brain tests + 58 dashboard tests (across 8 files).

### v2.1 Steward Console — MILESTONE COMPLETE (2026-04-21)

**Sprint 15 closed 2026-04-21, 18/18 plans = 100%.** Phases 5 (ReviewerNous), 6 (H1–H4 Operator Agency), 7 (Peer Dialogue Memory), 8 (H5 Sovereign Deletion) all shipped. Broadcast allowlist grew 10 → 18 across v2.1; every addition carries a closed-tuple payload and a sole-producer boundary; plaintext Telos / law body / memory refs / emotional state never cross the audit or RPC wire. The dashboard is a stewarded environment: Agency Indicator on every route, elevation-gated H1–H5 flows, peer-dialogue-driven Telos refinement with forgery guard, irreversible Nous deletion with pre-deletion state hash + typed-DID consent + audit-chain preservation forever. Zero-diff invariant unbroken since Phase 1. Research foundation validated: Stanford peer-agent synthesis (Zou HAI, SPARC, arxiv 2506.06576) mapped 1:1 to shipped phases.

**Next up:** v2.2 milestone planning.

---

## v2.2: Living Grid (IN PROGRESS — opened 2026-04-21)

**Goal:** Move Nous from observed entities into full agents. Six themes ship MVP depth together: Rich Inner Life (Ananke + Bios + Chronos), Relationship & Trust, Governance & Law, Mesh Whisper, Operator Observability, Researcher Tooling.

### Phase 10b — Bios Needs + Chronos Subjective Time (Inner Life, part 2) — SHIPPED 2026-04-22

**Shipped:** 2026-04-22
**Goal:** Bodily needs (energy, sustenance) elevate Ananke drives on threshold crossing; per-Nous subjective-time multiplier modulates Stanford retrieval recency. Adds bios.birth + bios.death to the allowlist (+2, corrected from original "0" estimate per D-10b-01).
**Requirements delivered:** BIOS-01, BIOS-02, BIOS-03, BIOS-04, CHRONOS-01, CHRONOS-02, CHRONOS-03
**Plans:** 8/8 (10b-01 through 10b-08, 4 waves)
**Allowlist added:** `bios.birth` (pos 20) + `bios.death` (pos 21) — allowlist 19→21

**Key primitives:**
- Brain-side `BiosRuntime` with two needs (energy, sustenance) in `[0.0, 1.0]`; rise-only with passive baseline decay; threshold crossing elevates matching Ananke drive (energy→hunger, sustenance→safety) once per crossing, not per tick
- `appendBiosBirth` sole-producer: closed 3-key payload `{did, tick, psyche_hash}` (psyche_hash = Brain-computed hash of Psyche init vector; no Big Five floats on wire)
- `appendBiosDeath` sole-producer: closed 4-key payload `{did, tick, cause, final_state_hash}`; `cause ∈ {starvation, operator_h5, replay_boundary}`
- D-30 extension: `delete-nous.ts` H5 handler emits `appendBiosDeath({cause: 'operator_h5'})` before `appendNousDeleted`
- Brain-side `ChronosRuntime`: subjective-time multiplier `[0.25, 4.0]` = `clamp(1.0 + curiosity_boost - boredom_penalty, 0.25, 4.0)`; modulates Stanford retrieval recency score; NEVER crosses wire, NEVER influences audit_tick
- Grid-side `ChronosListener` pure-observer: tracks `bios.birth` events, exposes `epochSinceSpawn(did, tick)` for Brain context
- Dashboard `BiosSection` between Ananke and Telos panels: bucketed levels (low/med/high), no numeric values
- `scripts/check-wallclock-forbidden.mjs` CI gate: two-tier pattern (Tier A: bios/chronos dirs fully ban datetime; Tier B: retrieval.py bans datetime.now() calls only)

**Invariants sealed:**
- `audit_tick === system_tick` across 1000 ticks with all Phase 10b event types (integration test)
- No wall-clock in Bios/Chronos/retrieval — enforced by CI grep-gate
- Body↔mood separation (PHILOSOPHY §1 subsection T-09-05 — Bios is body, Thymos is mood; distinct subsystems, non-negotiable distinction)
- Phase 6 D-17 pause/resume hash unchanged with ChronosListener wired (pure-observer A/B comparison)
- Phase 10b audit-size ceiling: 1000 ticks × 1 Nous ≤ 53 total events

**STRIDE threats addressed:** T-09-04 (Chronos wall-clock — grep gate), T-09-05 (Bios/Thymos namespace — PHILOSOPHY §1 sealed), T-09-03 (Bios needs-math tick-delta-only — grep gate).

---

### Phase 10a — Ananke Drives (Inner Life, part 1) — SHIPPED 2026-04-22

**Shipped:** 2026-04-22
**Goal:** Five drives (hunger, curiosity, safety, boredom, loneliness) run deterministically in the Brain; only threshold crossings cross the boundary as hash-authoritative broadcast.
**Requirements delivered:** DRIVE-01, DRIVE-02, DRIVE-03, DRIVE-04, DRIVE-05
**Plans:** 6/6 (10a-01, 10a-02, 10a-03, 10a-04, 10a-05, 10a-06)
**Allowlist added:** `ananke.drive_crossed` (+1 → 19)

**Key primitives:**
- Brain-side `AnankeRuntime` with piecewise deterministic recurrence (below baseline pulls up via `DECAY_FACTOR=exp(-1/500)`; above baseline pure rise by drive-specific rate)
- Hysteresis-guarded level bucketing (`low<0.33`, `med<0.66`, `high≥0.66` with ±0.02 band)
- Grid-side `appendAnankeDriveCrossed` sole-producer emitter with closed 5-key payload `{did, tick, drive, level, direction}` enforced via `Object.keys(payload).sort()` strict equality
- 3-keys-not-5 invariant: Brain returns 3 metadata keys; Grid injects `{did, tick}` at boundary
- Dashboard Drives panel with 45-state aria matrix + locked Unicode glyphs (⊘ ✦ ◆ ◯ ❍) + baseline bucketed mirror
- Zero-diff invariant extended: chain head byte-identical with/without Ananke listeners, modulo added `ananke.drive_crossed` entries
- Audit-size ceiling: 1000 ticks × 5 drives × 1 Nous ≤ 50 entries (T-09-01 defense)
- Wall-clock grep gates in both `brain/src/noesis_brain/ananke/**` and `grid/src/ananke/**` (T-09-03 defense)
- Three-tier privacy grep (Grid emitter + Brain wire + Dashboard render) preventing plaintext drive float leak (T-09-02 defense)
- Advisory-only drive→action coupling (PHILOSOPHY §6 Nous sovereignty preserved)

**STRIDE threats addressed:** T-09-01 (per-tick audit bloat — ceiling locked ≤50), T-09-02 (plaintext drive leak — three-tier grep), T-09-03 (wall-clock coupling — grep gates in both ananke source trees), T-10a-27..T-10a-33 (from Plan 10a-06 threat model).

**Next up:** Phase 11 — Mesh Whisper (SHIPPED 2026-04-23, see entry above).

---

### Phase 11 — Mesh Whisper — SHIPPED 2026-04-23

**Shipped:** 2026-04-23
**Goal:** Any two Nous can exchange E2E-encrypted envelopes via libsodium `crypto_box`; operators cannot read plaintext at any tier including H5; audit chain retains only `ciphertext_hash` forever.
**Requirements delivered:** WHISPER-01, WHISPER-02, WHISPER-03, WHISPER-04, WHISPER-05, WHISPER-06
**Plans:** 5/5 (11-00 through 11-04, 4 waves)
**Allowlist added:** `nous.whispered` (pos 22, alphabetical closed 4-key tuple `{ciphertext_hash, from_did, tick, to_did}`) — allowlist 21→22

**Key primitives:**
- `grid/src/whisper/crypto.ts`: libsodium `crypto_box_easy` wrapper — `encryptFor`, `decryptFrom`, `deriveNonce(seed, tick, counter)`, `hashCiphertext` (SHA-256 → 64-char hex); all deterministic, no wall-clock
- `grid/src/whisper/appendNousWhispered.ts`: sole producer for `nous.whispered`; closed 4-key alphabetical payload enforced by `Object.keys(payload).sort()` strict equality
- `WhisperRouter`: rate-limit gate (10/100 ticks per sender) → validation → encrypt → `appendNousWhispered` → `pendingStore.enqueue`; side-effects locked in order
- `PendingStore`: recipient-pull delivery; `drainFor(did, tick)` returns ciphertexts; `ackDelete(did, envelopeId)` removes after pull; plaintext never persisted
- Brain-side `whisper_router.py`: `send_whisper` / `receive_whispers` handlers; keyring scoped per Nous (D-11-04: no cross-Nous key access)
- Fastify endpoints: `POST /api/v1/nous/:did/whisper/send` + `GET /api/v1/nous/:did/whisper/receive` + `DELETE /api/v1/nous/:did/whisper/ack`
- Dashboard `WhisperSection`: counts-only panel `{sent, received, lastTick, topPartners}` — zero read/inspect affordance, `useWhisperCounts` hook over firehose `useMemo`

**Invariants sealed:**
- WHISPER_FORBIDDEN_KEYS (13 keys): `{text, body, content, message, utterance, offer, amount, ousia, price, value, plaintext, decrypted, payload_plain}` — 16-case privacy matrix + three-tier CI gate + runtime fs-guard
- Determinism: same `(whisperSeed, tick, counter)` → same `ciphertext_hash` regardless of `tickRateMs` (whisper-determinism.test.ts)
- Zero-diff: 0 vs N passive observers → byte-identical `eventHash` arrays (whisper-zero-diff.test.ts)
- Keyring isolation (D-11-04): no `grid/src/**` file imports `brain/*/whisper/keyring`; CI-enforced
- Fourth protocol mirror: `dashboard/src/lib/protocol/whisper-types.ts` + drift detector (whisper-types.drift.test.ts)
- Dashboard panel: zero `<button>`, zero `<a>`, zero ciphertext_hash rendered — 23 source-inspection tests

**STRIDE threats addressed:** T-10-01 (plaintext leak — three-tier grep gate + privacy matrix + runtime fs-guard), T-10-02 (flooding DoS — rate-limit + queue), T-10-03 (dashboard read affordance — source-inspection tests), T-10-04 (keyring isolation — CI gate), T-10-06 (whisper-as-trade bypass — `amount|ousia|offer|price` in FORBIDDEN_KEYS).

**Test coverage at completion:** Grid 1121/1121 (122 files), Brain 498/498, Dashboard Wave 4 30/30.
